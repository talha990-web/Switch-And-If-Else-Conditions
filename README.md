1. If-Else Condition:
The if-else condition is a decision-making statement used to execute one block of code if a condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

2. Switch Statement:
The switch statement is used when you have multiple possible conditions and want to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable.
It is often used as a cleaner alternative to multiple if-else statements when comparing the same variable.

Key Differences:
If-Else: More flexible, allows for complex conditions (e.g., using logical operators like AND and OR).
Switch: Generally cleaner when comparing a single variable to multiple values, but is less flexible than if-else when conditions are more complex.
